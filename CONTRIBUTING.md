# Contributing to Algorithmics

Adding new algorithms is always appreciated by us. Just consider a few things before making a PR:

1. Please make the contributions real (no simple whitespace addition/removal or typos) i.e. contribute significantly
2. Add any important and usable algorithm of your choice (make the method non-static and public in your public class)
3. Add unit tests for your code and take a look if your code style matches that of the project
4. Make sure the pipeline succeeds for your PR
5. Have fun!!!

*P.S. if you have any doubts regarding the addition of your algorithm, please create an issue and we can discuss it*
