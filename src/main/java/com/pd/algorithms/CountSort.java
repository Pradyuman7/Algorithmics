  //ALL ABOUT COUNT SORTING
  // Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements of an array by counting
  // the number of occurrences of each unique element in the array.The count is stored in
  // an auxiliary array and the sorting is done by mapping the count as an index of the
  // auxiliary array.
  // Time complexity: O(n+k) [n= no.of elements, k= range of input]

  // Counting sort is used when:
  //1.there are smaller integers with multiple counts.
  //2.linear complexity is the need.

  public int[] countSort(int n, int... arr) {
    //1.Find out the maximum element (let it be max) from the given array.
    int max = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (max < arr[i]) {
        max = arr[i];
      }

    }
    //2.Initialize an array of length max+1 with all elements 0.
    // This array is used for storing the count of the elements in the array.
    int[] count = new int[max + 1];

    //3.Store the count of each element at their respective index in count array.
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      count[arr[i]]++;
    }
    //4.Store cumulative sum of the elements of the count array.
    // It helps in placing the elements into the correct index of the sorted array.
    for (int i = 1; i < count.length; i++) {
      count[i] = count[i] + count[i - 1];
    }

    // place the elements in output array
